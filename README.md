# Livity

## Live Coding For Unity

Livity is a novel integrated coding environment for Unity focused on enabling very short feedback cycles
through an interactive coding experience including the ability to change running code on the fly.

Livity is available right now at the [Unity Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#content/11281).

## Live Coding From External Editors

Livity will live code enable your favorite coding environments.

See [how to setup Visual Studio for live coding](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTFdG_Uaia8).

A Sublime Text plugin is in the works.
